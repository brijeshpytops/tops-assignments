-- What is DDL Interpreter? 

-- DDL, which stands for Data Definition Language, is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for defining and managing database structures. The DDL Interpreter is a component of a database management system (DBMS) responsible for interpreting and executing Data Definition Language statements.

-- The primary purpose of DDL is to define the database schema, including the creation, modification, and deletion of database objects such as tables, indexes, and views. Some common DDL statements include:

-- CREATE: Used to create database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and more.

CREATE TABLE employees (
   employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
   first_name VARCHAR(50),
   last_name VARCHAR(50),
   hire_date DATE
);


-- ALTER: Used to modify the structure of existing database objects.

ALTER TABLE employees
ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);


-- DROP: Used to delete database objects.

DROP TABLE employees;


-- The DDL Interpreter takes these statements as input, checks for syntax errors, verifies the validity of the operations requested, and then executes them to make the corresponding changes to the database schema. It is responsible for maintaining the metadata that describes the structure of the database.

-- It's important to note that DDL statements are typically executed by database administrators or users with the necessary privileges, as they have a significant impact on the overall structure of the database. The DDL Interpreter ensures that these operations are performed in a controlled and secure manner, following the rules and constraints specified in the database schema.
