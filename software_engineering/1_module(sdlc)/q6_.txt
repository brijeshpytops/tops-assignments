What is Use case Diagram? Create a use-case on bill payment on paytm.

A use case diagram is a visual representation of the interactions between different actors (users or systems) and a system. It helps to illustrate the different ways a system can be used by various actors and the interactions between them.

For a bill payment use case on Paytm, we can identify the following actors:

User: The individual using the Paytm application to pay bills.
Paytm System: The system itself, which facilitates bill payments.


Now, let's create a simple use case diagram:
