What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC

SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle):
---------------------------------------
SDLC is a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, deploying, and maintaining information systems. It provides a structured approach to software development and is designed to produce high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations. The SDLC consists of several phases, each with its specific goals and activities. The typical phases of SDLC are as follows:

1. Planning:
------------
Objective: Define the scope, purpose, and objectives of the project. Identify constraints, risks, and resources.
Activities:
Conduct feasibility studies.
Define project scope and requirements.
Develop a project plan, including timelines and resource allocation.
Assess risks and plan for risk management.

2. Feasibility Study:
---------------------
Objective: Evaluate the technical, operational, and economic feasibility of the proposed system.
Activities:
Examine technical aspects, such as hardware and software requirements.
Assess operational feasibility by considering how well the system solves the problem.
Evaluate economic feasibility by analyzing costs and benefits.

3. Design:
----------
Objective: Create a blueprint for the software system based on the requirements.
Activities:
System Design: Define overall system architecture and components.
High-Level Design: Develop a detailed representation of the system's architecture.
Detailed Design: Specify data structures, algorithms, and interfaces.
User Interface Design: Design the system's user interface.

4. Implementation (Coding):
---------------------------
Objective: Transform the design into actual code and implement the system.
Activities:
Write code based on the detailed design.
Conduct unit testing to ensure individual components work as expected.
Integrate components into a complete system.

5. Testing:
-----------
Objective: Verify that the software functions correctly and meets the specified requirements.
Activities:
Conduct various testing activities, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.
Identify and fix defects.

6. Deployment:
--------------
Objective: Release the software to end-users or customers.
Activities:
Develop deployment plans.
Install the software on target environments.
Provide training and support to end-users.

7. Maintenance and Support:
---------------------------
Objective: Ensure that the software remains effective and efficient over time.
Activities:
Address bug fixes and issues reported by users.
Make enhancements or updates to adapt to changes in requirements or technology.
Provide ongoing support and maintenance.
