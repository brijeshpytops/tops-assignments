What is software? What is software engineering? 

Software:
---------
Software refers to a set of instructions, programs, or data that enable a computer to perform specific tasks. It encompasses everything that is not hardware â€“ the tangible, physical components of a computer system. Software can be categorized into two main types:

System Software: 
----------------
This includes operating systems, device drivers, and utilities that enable the computer hardware to function and provide a platform for running application software.

Application Software: 
---------------------
These are programs designed to perform specific tasks for end-users, such as word processors, web browsers, games, and more.

In essence, software is the intangible part of a computer system that allows it to carry out various functions and tasks.

Software Engineering:
---------------------
Software engineering is a systematic and disciplined approach to designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It involves the application of engineering principles to software development, aiming to produce high-quality software that meets user requirements, is reliable, maintainable, and scalable.

Key aspects of software engineering include:

Requirements Engineering: 
-------------------------
Understanding and documenting the needs and constraints of the end-users to define the software's functional and non-functional requirements.

Design: 
-------
Creating a blueprint or plan for the software system based on the specified requirements.

Implementation: 
---------------
Writing the actual code based on the design, following best practices and coding standards.

Testing: 
--------
Systematically evaluating the software to ensure that it behaves as expected, identifying and fixing any defects.

Maintenance: 
------------
Making updates and modifications to the software to address changes in requirements, fix bugs, or improve performance.

Project Management: 
-------------------
Coordinating the efforts of a team of developers, ensuring that the project is completed on time and within budget.
