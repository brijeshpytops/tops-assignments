// What is the difference between OOP and POP?

/*
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and POP (Procedural-Oriented Programming) are two different programming paradigms that represent different approaches to designing and organizing code. Here are the key differences between OOP and POP:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):

Focus:
------
Objects: OOP focuses on organizing code into objects, which are instances of classes. Objects encapsulate data and behavior.
Abstraction: It emphasizes abstraction, allowing developers to model real-world entities and their interactions in the form of classes and objects.

Key Concepts:
-------------
Classes and Objects: OOP uses classes and objects to structure code.
Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism: These are core principles of OOP, providing mechanisms for data hiding, code reuse, and the ability to represent different types of objects through a common interface.

Code Organization:
------------------
Modularity: OOP promotes modularity by encapsulating related data and behavior within classes, making code more organized and maintainable.
Reusability: Code can be reused through inheritance and composition, reducing redundancy.

Example Languages:
------------------
Java, C++, Python, Ruby, and many modern languages are designed with strong support for OOP.

POP (Procedural-Oriented Programming):
--------------------------------------
Focus:
------
Procedures and Functions: POP focuses on procedures or routines, which are sets of instructions to be executed sequentially.
Data: Data is separate from the procedures that operate on it.

Key Concepts:
------------
Procedures and Functions: Code is organized into procedures or functions that perform specific tasks.
Sequential Execution: The program flow follows a sequential path, with one instruction executed after another.

Code Organization:
------------------
Top-Down Design: Code is often designed in a top-down manner, breaking down tasks into smaller procedures.
Data and Behavior Separation: Data and the procedures that manipulate it are often separate, leading to a more procedural style of programming.

Example Languages:
------------------
Early programming languages like C, Fortran, and BASIC are examples of languages that primarily follow the procedural paradigm.
