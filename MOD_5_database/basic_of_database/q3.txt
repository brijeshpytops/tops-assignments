What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?

DBMS (Database Management System) and RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) are both systems that manage databases, but there are key differences between the two:

Data Structure:

DBMS: A DBMS can manage any type of data, including text, numbers, multimedia, etc. It does not necessarily follow a relational model, and the data may not be stored in tables with relationships.
RDBMS: An RDBMS specifically follows the relational model. Data is organized into tables with rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established using keys.
Data Integrity:

DBMS: Data integrity features may be limited. It may not enforce relationships between tables or support features like foreign keys.
RDBMS: RDBMS systems enforce data integrity through normalization, keys (primary and foreign keys), and referential integrity constraints.
Complexity:

DBMS: Generally less complex than RDBMS. Suitable for simpler data storage needs without the need for complex relationships and constraints.
RDBMS: More complex due to the adherence to the relational model. It provides a more structured and organized way of storing and retrieving data, making it suitable for applications with complex data relationships.
Scalability:

DBMS: May have limitations in terms of scalability, especially when dealing with large amounts of data and complex relationships.
RDBMS: Designed to handle scalability better. The relational model and normalization help in managing large datasets efficiently.
Data Retrieval:

DBMS: Retrieval methods may not be as sophisticated. Queries may be more straightforward but may lack the powerful querying capabilities of SQL in RDBMS.
RDBMS: Utilizes SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying, providing a powerful and standardized way to retrieve data from the database.
Examples:

DBMS: File systems, early database systems that may not strictly follow the relational model.
RDBMS: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server are examples of RDBMS.
