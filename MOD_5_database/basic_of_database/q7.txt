What is DML Compiler in SQL?

In SQL (Structured Query Language), a DML (Data Manipulation Language) compiler is not a term commonly used. Instead, the DML operations are typically executed by the SQL database engine or the SQL query processor rather than a separate "compiler."

DML comprises the SQL commands that deal with the manipulation of data stored in a database. 

The main DML statements include:

SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.

SELECT column1, column2 FROM tablename WHERE condition;

INSERT: Adds new records to a table.

INSERT INTO tablename (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);

UPDATE: Modifies existing records in a table.

UPDATE tablename SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition;

DELETE: Removes records from a table.

DELETE FROM tablename WHERE condition;
