What is SQL Key Constraints writing an Example of SQL Key Constraints

In SQL, key constraints are used to define rules or conditions on columns that ensure the uniqueness and integrity of data within a table. There are different types of key constraints, including Primary Key and Unique Key. 

Primary Key Constraint:

A Primary Key uniquely identifies each record in a table and ensures that the column or combination of columns specified as the primary key does not contain duplicate or NULL values.

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INT
);



Unique Key Constraint:

A Unique Key ensures that the values in a column or a combination of columns are unique across all records in the table. Unlike the primary key, a unique key can allow NULL values.

CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    manager_id INT UNIQUE
);
