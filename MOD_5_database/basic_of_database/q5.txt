What do you understand By Data Redundancy?


Data redundancy refers to the duplication of data within a database or information system. It occurs when the same piece of data is stored in multiple places. Redundancy can lead to several issues, including increased storage requirements, data inconsistency, and a higher risk of data anomalies. There are three main types of data redundancy:

Horizontal Data Redundancy:

Occurs when identical or similar data is repeated in different rows of the same database table.
It can result from poor database design or denormalization.

Example:
| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | Department   |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1          | John Doe     | HR           |
| 2          | Jane Smith   | Sales        |
| 3          | John Doe     | HR           |  <-- Redundant data


Vertical Data Redundancy:

Involves the storage of the same attribute in multiple tables.
It can be a consequence of poor table design or denormalization.

Example:
Table: Employees
| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | Department   |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1          | John Doe     | HR           |
| 2          | Jane Smith   | Sales        |

Table: Departments
| DepartmentID | DepartmentName  | Manager     |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| HR           | Human Resources | John Doe    |  <-- Redundant data


Temporal Data Redundancy:

Involves storing the same data at different points in time.
It can occur in systems where historical data is kept but not properly managed.

Example:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | Department   | Salary | EffectiveDate |
|------------|--------------|--------------|--------|---------------|
| 1          | John Doe     | HR           | 5000   | 2022-01-01    |
| 1          | John Doe     | HR           | 5200   | 2023-01-01    |  <-- Redundant data
